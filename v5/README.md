# ews-mcp 4.5 — Exchange (EWS) as a safe, fast MCP tool surface

An MCP server that turns an on-prem Exchange mailbox into a lean,
safety-gated tool surface for an LLM assistant: **28 tools**, alias-only
ids, token-lean DTOs, a local cache mirror with Arabic-correct full-text
search, and a two-phase confirm flow that makes autonomous sending
tamper-evident.

> The `v5/` directory name is an internal path; the release line is
> **4.5.x** (`ghcr.io/…:v4.5*`). Architecture: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).
> Full API reference: [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

## Quick start — run it locally over stdio (no Docker)

stdio is the default transport and the simplest way to use this server:
your MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or any other) starts
`ewsmcp` as a child process and talks to it over stdin/stdout. There is
no port, no API key, and nothing listening on the network — and because
it runs as a normal process on your machine, it reaches Exchange through
whatever network your machine has, **including a corporate VPN**. If
your Exchange endpoint is only reachable from your workstation, this is
the mode you want; a container or a remote host would not have that
route.

**1. Install** (Python 3.11+):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azizmazrou/ews-mcp && cd ews-mcp
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install ./v5
```

You now have an `ewsmcp` command inside the venv:
`.venv/bin/ewsmcp` — on Windows `.venv\Scripts\ewsmcp.exe`. Use that
**absolute path** in the client configs below.

**2. Connect Claude Code** (one command, then restart the session):

```bash
claude mcp add exchange \
  -e EWS_SERVER_URL="https://mail.example.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx" \
  -e EWS_EMAIL="user@example.com" \
  -e EWS_USERNAME="user" \
  -e EWS_PASSWORD="…" \
  -- /absolute/path/to/.venv/bin/ewsmcp
```

On Windows, write it on one line and point at `ewsmcp.exe`. Check with
`claude mcp list` — the server should show as connected.

**3. Or Claude Desktop** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json`
(Settings → Developer → Edit Config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exchange": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\.venv\\Scripts\\ewsmcp.exe",
      "env": {
        "EWS_SERVER_URL": "https://mail.example.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx",
        "EWS_EMAIL": "user@example.com",
        "EWS_USERNAME": "user",
        "EWS_PASSWORD": "…"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Any other MCP client works the same way: command = the `ewsmcp` path,
credentials in `env`. Prefer a file? Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example)
to `.env` in the directory you launch `ewsmcp` from — it auto-loads.

That is the whole setup. The defaults are safe: capability tier `draft`
(23 read + draft tools; nothing can send), `SEND_ENABLED=false` until
you flip it, and mail-at-rest (aliases, audit chain, cache) goes to
`~/.ewsmcp`. The server **refuses cloud-synced folders** for that data —
if your home directory lives in OneDrive/Dropbox/iCloud, set `DATA_DIR`
to a plain local path.

**First things to try in a chat:**

- "What's in my inbox this morning?" → `get_mailbox_overview`
- "Find the last message from the finance team" → `search_messages`
- "Show me that whole conversation" → `get_thread`
- "Draft a short reply to m3 saying I'll confirm tomorrow" →
  `create_draft` (saved as a draft, never sent)
- "What's on my calendar this week?" → `list_events`

Ids like `m3` / `e1` are the server's short aliases — the assistant uses
them exactly as returned; raw Exchange ids never appear.

## HTTP transport (only when the server runs on another machine)

If the server runs where the client isn't (a home server, for example),
serve HTTP instead:

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=http MCP_PORT=8000 MCP_API_KEY=<long-random-string> ewsmcp
```

- MCP endpoint: `http://host:8000/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, the modern
  replacement for SSE). Clients that only speak stdio can bridge:
  `npx mcp-remote http://host:8000/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <key>"`.
- Plain REST for scripts: `POST /api/tools/<name>` with an `x-api-key`
  header; OpenAPI at `/openapi.json`.
- Health: `GET /livez`, `/readyz`, `/health`.
- OAuth discovery paths (`/.well-known/oauth-*`, `/register`) always
  404 — this server implements no OAuth, and `MCP_API_KEY` never gates
  them, specifically so an OAuth-aware MCP client (LibreChat included)
  sees "not supported" and falls back to its configured headers instead
  of getting stuck offering an OAuth login that has nowhere to go.

Docker (containerized HTTP mode — note a container only sees the
network of its host, not your workstation's VPN):

```bash
docker build -t ews-mcp:dev .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env -v ewsmcp-data:/data ews-mcp:dev
```

### Multi-user mode (one server, per-person Exchange identity)

For a shared deployment (e.g. an MCP gateway behind a chat platform like
LibreChat) where each person should act as *themselves* against
Exchange, not a shared service mailbox, set `EWS_MULTI_USER=true`.
`EWS_EMAIL`/`EWS_USERNAME`/`EWS_PASSWORD` are then ignored (and
`EWS_EMAIL` is no longer required at boot) — instead, **every** MCP and
REST call must carry:

```
X-EWS-Email: person@corp.example
X-EWS-Password: their-own-exchange-password
```

A request without both headers gets a clean `auth_failed` (401), not a
tool error. Credentials are never persisted: each (email, password) pair
resolves to a short-lived per-user Exchange session (`EWSGateway`),
cached in memory only for reuse across that user's own calls (bounded to
64 users, idle-evicted after 15 minutes; a changed password rebuilds
rather than reusing the old session) and torn down on eviction. Because
identity is now per-request, this mode also turns off everything that
would otherwise mix data between users: no cache mirror, no audit log,
no alias DB, no semantic index — every read is a live EWS call. HTTP
transport only (stdio is one already-authenticated local process, with
no per-request header to attach credentials to).

For LibreChat specifically, wire this up with
[`customUserVars`](https://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/mcp_servers)
in `librechat.yaml` so each signed-in user enters their own Exchange
email + password once (via LibreChat's own settings UI), which
LibreChat then substitutes into the headers on every call:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  exchange:
    type: streamable-http
    url: http://ews-mcp:8000/mcp
    headers:
      X-EWS-Email: "{{EWS_EMAIL}}"
      X-EWS-Password: "{{EWS_PASSWORD}}"
    customUserVars:
      EWS_EMAIL:
        title: "Exchange email"
        description: "Your Exchange mailbox address"
      EWS_PASSWORD:
        title: "Exchange password"
        description: "Your Exchange password (stored by LibreChat, sent only to this server)"
```

## Why it looks like this

- **Token economy.** One legacy detail call shipped 115 kB of duplicated
  raw HTML for a 150-char message. Here a search result is a ~60-token
  card, bodies are cleaned once at sync time (bilingual quoted-history +
  signature stripping), and raw HTML requires an explicit flag.
- **Ids the model can actually copy.** Raw EWS ids are ~150 chars of
  case-sensitive base64 that change when items move. Tools emit short
  aliases (`m12`, `e3`) that survive moves and restarts.
- **Safety by declaration.** Handlers contain zero policy; ONE dispatcher
  chain enforces kill-switch → tier → recipient guard → content-bound
  two-phase confirm → rate cap. Defaults are safe: sends disabled,
  draft tier.
- **Cache-first reads.** A background delta-sync (native EWS
  `SyncFolderItems`) keeps a per-mailbox SQLite mirror; warm reads answer
  in milliseconds with `{"source": "cache", "as_of": …}` provenance and
  fall back to live EWS transparently. Arabic searches match across
  orthographic variants (alef/hamza forms, teh marbuta, diacritics,
  Arabic-Indic digits).
- **Never-exit boot.** Transports bind before any Exchange contact;
  `/livez` is up immediately, `/readyz` reports the warmup honestly, and
  the connection manager owns recovery.

## Configuration (env)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `EWS_SERVER_URL` / `EWS_EMAIL` / `EWS_USERNAME` / `EWS_PASSWORD` | — | Exchange endpoint + credentials (auth auto-negotiation; never pinned) |
| `EWS_CAPABILITY_TIER` | `draft` | `read` ⊂ `draft` ⊂ `full` — above-tier tools are unregistered AND refused |
| `SEND_ENABLED` | `false` | Global send kill-switch (blocks every send-class tool) |
| `EWS_RECIPIENT_ALLOWLIST` / `EWS_RECIPIENT_DENYLIST` | — | Glob lists enforced on argument-borne AND draft-resolved recipients |
| `EWS_MAX_SENDS_PER_HOUR` | `10` | Send rate cap |
| `SEND_CONFIRM_SECRET` | per-process | HMAC secret for confirm tokens (set it to survive restarts) |
| `CONFIRM_TTL_SECONDS` | `600` | Confirm token lifetime |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` / `MCP_HOST` / `MCP_PORT` / `MCP_API_KEY` | stdio | HTTP serving + bearer auth (all unused in stdio mode) |
| `EWS_MULTI_USER` | `false` | Per-request `X-EWS-Email`/`X-EWS-Password` credentials instead of a shared mailbox (HTTP transport only) — see "Multi-user mode" above |
| `DATA_DIR` | `~/.ewsmcp` | Aliases, audit chain, cache mirror. Absolute; cloud-synced paths are refused (`DATA_DIR_ALLOW_SYNCED=true` to override) |
| `EWS_CACHE_ENABLED` | `true` | The mirror; `false` = pure live EWS reads |
| `EWS_CACHE_FOLDERS` | `inbox,sent` | Delta-synced folders |
| `EWS_CACHE_SYNC_SECONDS` | `45` | Delta cadence (folder tree/calendar/tasks every 10 min) |
| `EWS_CACHE_WINDOW_DAYS` | `365` | Mirror backfill window |
| `EWS_CACHE_PURGE_ON_BOOT` | `false` | Admin path: wipe the mirror and resync |
| `EWS_SEMANTIC_INDEX` | `none` | `pgvector` enables the optional vector tier (+`find_similar`) |
| `EWS_SEMANTIC_PG_DSN` / `EWS_SEMANTIC_OLLAMA_URL` / `EWS_SEMANTIC_MODEL` | — | Vector tier wiring (requires `psycopg`, not a core dependency) |
| `EWS_TZ` | `Asia/Riyadh` | Server timezone for date grammar + display |

## The send flow (two-phase, content-bound)

```text
create_draft(mode="reply", reply_to="m12", body="…")
  → {draft_id: "d1", preview, note: "saved as draft — NOT sent"}
send_draft(draft_id="d1")
  → phase 1: fetches the draft, returns its REAL recipients/subject/body
    snippet + confirm_token bound to that content (nothing sent)
send_draft(draft_id="d1", confirm_token="…")
  → phase 2: REFETCHES the draft, verifies the content still matches,
    sends once (tokens are single-use; editing the draft in between
    invalidates the token)
```

## Health & operations

`GET /livez` (process up), `GET /readyz` (connection state, honest 503
while warming), `GET /health` (tool count), `GET /metrics` (Prometheus,
bearer-authenticated), `get_server_status` tool (connection, tier,
kill-switch, cache watermarks, sync status — works while cold and over
stdio too). Audit chain:
`python scripts/verify_audit_chain.py $DATA_DIR/audit`.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
python -m pytest tests -q          # the full suite, no Exchange needed
python -m ruff check .
python scripts/boot_smoke.py full  # end-to-end boot against a dead endpoint
python scripts/dump_tool_table.py --check   # docs vs registry drift gate
```

## Example assistant skill

`examples/skills/exchange-assistant/` shows how a Claude skill composes
this tool surface (morning overview → triage → reply-draft with the
two-phase confirm). It is deliberately generic — judgment lives in the
calling assistant, the server stays a data plane.
